           Hi, I'm Ryan Kinney, I'm 18 like video games and have previously taken a programming course at WEST-MEC
           I'm taking this class because it was recommended for me to do so by my advisor but also because I have
           a general love for programming and everything that has to do with it. Overall taking this class online
           seemed far easier than in person, especially when while we have a vaccine the pandemic has only slowed
           and not stopped yet I would like to be employed in this industry as either a web developer or software
           engineer.
